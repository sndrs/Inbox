# [Inbox by Gmail](https://inbox.google.com) app.

This is desktop app that wraps Inbox providing some OS niceties like notifications, a dock icon and badgeing etc.

It's very, very early stages of development, but I'm using it.

## Installation

There's no application yet, you need to build it yourself (there will be when it's finished).

That's pretty easy though. Checkout the repo, then:

`make install`
`make bundle`

## Development

It's built using [Electron](http://electron.atom.io).

`make` will create a temporary Electron app in dev.
