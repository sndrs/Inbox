Desktop app for [Inbox by Gmail](https://inbox.google.com) that adds OS integration:

- system notifications
- a dock icon with unread count

It's still in development, but it should be stable enough. I use it everyday.

## Installation

There's no downloadable app yet, you need to build it yourself (there will be when it's finished).

That's pretty easy though. Checkout the repo, then:

`make install`

`make bundle`

## Development

It's built using [Electron](http://electron.atom.io).

`make` will create a temporary Electron app in dev.
