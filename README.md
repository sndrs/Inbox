Desktop app for [Inbox by Gmail](https://inbox.google.com) that adds OS integration:

- new mail notifications
- unread count in the dock

It's still in development, but it should be stable enough (I use it everyday).

## Installation

<a href="https://github.com/sndrs/Inbox/releases/latest">Download Inbox for OS X</a>.

To build for OS X, clone the repo, then:

`make install`

`make bundle`

For Windows or Linux, you'll need to build it yourself.

That should be pretty easy though â€“ take a look at the build options for [electron-packager](https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron-packager) (and then maybe submit a little PR if you get it working nicely :wink:)

## Development

It's built using [Electron](http://electron.atom.io).

`make` will create a temporary Electron app in dev.
